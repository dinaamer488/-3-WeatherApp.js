# [0]- WeatherApp.js

## Short Description

A simple JavaScript weather app that lets you search for a city and get current weather info.

## Description

WeatherApp-js- is a lightweight web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a weather API to fetch and display up-to-date weather data for any city entered by the user. The app is easy to understand, customize, and extend — ideal for learning or small projects.

## Features

- Search for any city to get current weather  
- Display temperature, weather condition, humidity (and other data if available)  
- Clean and simple UI with minimal dependencies  
- Easy to customize and extend  

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinaamer488/WeatherApp-js-.git
   
Open index.html in your browser (or the main HTML file).

Enter a city name in the search input, then submit to see the weather data.

No build tools or installations required — just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Usage Ideas / How to Extend

Add more weather details (wind speed, sunrise/sunset, forecast for next days)

Improve UI/UX: responsive design, nice icons, loading state, error handling

Add a “recent searches” history or store favorite cities in localStorage

Add more languages or allow switching between units (°C / °F)

Use a real weather‑API (if not already) and allow fetching forecasts, not just current weather
